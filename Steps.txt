Step-by-Step Plan for Your Software
🔧 Tech Stack
1. Backend/Logic: Python
2. Database: MySQL
3. GUI: Tkinter

🧩 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
0. create env
1. Install Requirements
pip install mysql-connector-python

2. Set Up Your MySQL Database
Use the schema I mentioned earlier (if you want I can give you the full SQL script again).

🖼️ Step 2: Basic GUI with Tkinter
Let’s begin by creating a simple main window where you can:
Add citizens
Add goods
Record delivery
Distribute goods
View reports


🚀 Let's Start:
Step 1: db.py
Step 2: Create main.py (Initial Window)
Step 3. build citizens.py: Add a citizen, View list of citizens
Step4. goods.py
Step5. distribution.py 
Step6. reports.py.



############### 🚀 Let's Start: Coding ###############

###############  Step 1: db.py

What We Need to Track
Relationships:
Suppliers → provide goods to → Companies
Companies → deliver goods to → Citizens
Every delivery should trace back to a supplier, company, and the good.
Every distribution to a citizen should indicate which company performed the distribution (optional but very useful).
Suppliers ─┬──> Deliveries <──┬── Companies
           │                 │
           └──> Goods        └──> Distributions <── Citizens

What happens when you run it all at once:
1. MySQL will sequentially execute each command:
First drops the database if it exists:
Creates a new database
Switches to that database
Creates all tables one by one
Inserts the initial goods data

2. All commands either succeed together or fail together (if you use transactions)


###############  Step 2: Create main.py (Initial Window)
# main.py
# we will considder this as a main module. 
# we will run all the code in the main.py file
# we will connect all the functions and modules in the main.py file
# we will consider the whole tables inside distribution_system.sql with other functions inside other modules and their relations
## I need to apply all the changes to the main.py file and run it to test the whole system 


############### Step 3. build citizens.py:
Awesome! Let’s build the full implementation of citizens.py, which will include:

✅ Features:
Add a new citizen
View the list of citizens
Optional: Delete a citizen


✅ How to Use
Add this file as citizens.py in your project folder.
Run the main app using main.py.
Click "Manage Citizens" to:
Add new citizen
View citizen list

Extra feature:
Search/filter by name/national ID?
Updated citizens.py with Search/Filter Functionality
We'll add:
A search bar (Entry widget)
A dropdown to choose whether to filter by Name or National ID
Automatic list update as you type



###############  Step4. goods.py
✅ What goods.py Should Do
1.View Goods List
2.Add New Deliveries
Select Good
Select Supplier
Select Company
Quantity & Date

3. Automatically increase stock of a good when a delivery is made

4. Maintain relations with:
Goods
Suppliers
Companies
Deliveries


🧩 Database Relations (Handled Here)
- Deliveries references:
good_id → Goods
supplier_id → Suppliers
company_id → Companies

- Stock is updated in the Goods table upon delivery

Extra feature:
✅ Updated goods.py with Delivery History Section:
Append this to the end of open_goods_window() (after the delivery form)

Great choice! Let’s add a Delivery History View to your goods.py module so you can:
See all deliveries ever made
Track which supplier and company provided the goods
See the quantity and date of delivery


###############  Step5. distribution.py 

Distribution module (goods → citizens) for tracking what each citizen received 

Awesome! Let’s now build the full Distribution Module to track which citizens received which goods, from which company, and when.

🧪What This Module Lets You Do:
Distribute goods to citizens (with checks on stock)
Automatically reduce inventory stock
Track all distributions with full history

What the Distribution Module Will Do:
✅ Allow you to:
Select a citizen
Select a good
Select the company that distributed it
Enter quantity given
Automatically reduce the stock
View a full distribution history

🧩 Connected Tables Recap
Distributions (joins):
citizens → goods → companies
Automatically decreases stock in the Goods table

🧩 Related Tables Recap:
Distributions: 
citizen_id → Citizens
good_id → Goods
company_id → Companies 

Let's implement the requested features:
1. Export History to Excel
We'll use the openpyxl library to export the distribution history to an Excel file. This allows for easy sharing or archiving.

2. Show Per-Citizen History View
To show a history of goods distributed to a specific citizen, we need to add a selection field where the user can choose a citizen, and the table will then display only that citizen's distribution history.
Modify the open_distribution_window() to include this feature:

###############  Step6. reports.py.  
Generate Reports;
Example: Show total goods distributed per item.
To implement the reports.py module, we can create a function that generates reports based on specific queries. One of the reports we want is to show the total goods distributed per item.
1. Setting Up the reports.py Module
This module will include functions that generate reports by querying the database. You can extend this module to include more types of reports as needed.
Explanation of Code:
Database Connection: The connect_db() function establishes a connection to the SQLite database. You can change this to your desired database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, if needed.

Report Functions:

total_goods_per_item_report(): This function generates a report that shows the total quantity of each good distributed.

total_goods_per_company_report(): This function generates a report showing the total quantity of goods distributed by each company.

total_goods_per_citizen_report(): This function generates a report showing the total quantity of goods distributed to each citizen.

Each report uses a SQL SELECT query to fetch relevant data and displays it in a Treeview widget, which is part of the Tkinter GUI.
Main Report Window (open_reports_window()): The main window allows the user to choose which report to generate. When the user clicks on a button, the corresponding report function is called, and the data is displayed in a new window.

Export to Excel (export_to_excel):
def export_to_excel(data, columns, filename):
This function takes the data (rows from the database), columns (column names), and a filename (name of the Excel file) as arguments.
It uses pandas to create a DataFrame from the data and saves it to an Excel file using df.to_excel(). The openpyxl engine is used for writing to the Excel file.

###################### Run main.py   ###################

✅ 1. Run main.py to start your application
Make sure:

You have Python installed.
You have all the required packages installed: mysql-connector-python, tkinter, openpyxl, or pandas (if you're exporting Excel reports).

💻 How to run it:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your main.py file.
Run this: bash
python main.py
This will launch your full GUI application window.
