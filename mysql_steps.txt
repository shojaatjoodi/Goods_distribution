############### Setting Up MySQL for the First Time  ###############
If you haven't created a MySQL account yet, yes, this will cause problems when trying to run commands. Let me walk you through the complete setup process from scratch.

Step 1: Install MySQL (If Not Already Installed)
First, you need to have MySQL installed on your system:
For Windows:
Download MySQL Installer from mysql.com
Run the installer and select "Server only" or "Full" installation
Follow the setup wizard (note the root password you set)

Step 2: Secure Your MySQL Installation (Recommended)
After installation, run: in bash 
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Step3:
from search bar open MySQL Command Line Client: 
pass your password

create db:
.............................................


Creating a Database and Running Your Script in MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client
Here's a complete step-by-step guide to create your database and execute your script using the MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client:

Step 1: Launch MySQL Command Line Client
Open the Start Menu and search for "MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client"

Click to launch it (you may need to run as administrator if you get permission errors)

Step 2: Log in to MySQL
You'll be prompted for your password:

Enter password: ********
(Enter the root password you set during MySQL installation)

Step 3: Create the Database
At the mysql> prompt, execute:

sql
CREATE DATABASE distribution_system;
Verify it was created:

sql
SHOW DATABASES;
(You should see "distribution_system" in the list)

Step 4: Prepare Your SQL Script
Save your script as "distribution_system.sql" in an easy-to-find location

Example: C:\mysql_scripts\distribution_system.sql
C:/dev/Git/Goods_distribution/distribution_system.sql


Make sure the file contains your complete script (including the CREATE DATABASE statement)

Step 5: Run Your Script:

Method 1: Using SOURCE command (inside MySQL client)
sql:
USE distribution_system;
then: past and run:
SOURCE C:/dev/Git/Goods_distribution/distribution_system.sql;
(Note: Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows)

Method 2: From Command Prompt (outside MySQL client)
Open a new Command Prompt (not the MySQL client)
Navigate to where your SQL file is located:
cmd
cd C:\mysql_scripts
Run:

cmd
mysql -u root -p distribution_system < distribution_system.sql
(Enter your password when prompted)

##### Step 6: Verify the Database Structure
Back in the MySQL client:
sql:
USE distribution_system;
SHOW TABLES;
You should see all your tables:
+-----------------------------+
| Tables_in_distribution_system |
+-----------------------------+
| Citizens                    |
| Companies                   |
| Deliveries                  |
| Distributions               |
| Goods                       |
| Suppliers                   |
+-----------------------------+
Step 7: Check Sample Data
sql
SELECT * FROM Goods;
(Should show your 10 prepopulated goods)



#### Troubleshooting Tips:
File Not Found:

Double-check the path to your SQL file

On Windows, you can use the full path with forward slashes: SOURCE C:/path/to/file.sql

Permission Issues:

Run Command Prompt as Administrator

Make sure your MySQL user has proper privileges

Script Errors:

If you get syntax errors, try running the script line by line

Check for missing semicolons

Character Encoding Issues:

Save your SQL file as UTF-8 encoding

Add this at the top of your SQL file: /*!40101 SET NAMES utf8 */;

Alternative Approach (If You Prefer)
If you want to avoid the SOURCE command, you can:

Open your SQL file in a text editor

Copy the entire content

In MySQL client, right-click to paste the content

Press Enter to execute
